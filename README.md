# 8480 Project
 This is a project for 8480 Network Science. The goal of this project is to
 implement and analyze the HITS algorithm and PageRank, comparing the two.

 After downloading the project, simply choose between the two build
 configurations (HITS or PageRank) and run. You will be prompted to choose one
 of three datasets on which to perform whichever algorithm you are running. The
 algorithm will run and then show some of the scores calculated.
